          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>With the plot above, we can discover some trends in health care in America. Most obvious
            is the percentage of the population that lacks health care compared to the percentage of the
            state's population in poverty. Even more obvious, the higher the income, the less percentage
            of the population lacks health care.</p>

          <p>Some correlation between the percentage of the population considered obese and the percentage
            of the population that is both in poverty and income can also be observed. The higher the percentage
            in poverty, the more likely the population is obese, while on the opposite the higher the income the
            less chance for the population to be obese. Those that are in poverty are unable to afford foods that
            are nutritious.</p>

          <p>Last, looking at comparison of age to the percentage of smokers, we see more of a cluster of data
            versus a standout trend. The data clusters around the median age of 38, ranging from 14 percent to 
            26 percent of the population that smokes. However, we do see a trend between smokers and the percent
            of population in poverty and the median income. As with obesity, the higher percent of a population that
            is in poverty will be more likely to smoke, while the higher the median income, the less likely a person
            is to smoke. This can likely be attributed to those with higher income having more access to resources
            that will show the dangers of smoking.
