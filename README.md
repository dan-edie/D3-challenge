# D3-challenge
Project based on D3 library and creating interactive plots

This project is the culmiation of learning D3 features and methods. It consists of creating a website with an interactive
plot based on data given to us from 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. This data consists of percentages of people who are
considered obese, who smoke, who lack healthcare, and are in poverty. In addition, it also has the median age and the
median income for those included in the data.

The inteactive plot uses all of this data to allow the user to create nine seperate plots based on what they would like
to compare. This allows a user to visually navigate the data without having to look at each plot individually.

This gives a base to expand my abilities to create visual data that is interesting to a viewer. I found D3 plots to be
easy to create, though the techniques to build a professional plot did take time, and more experience will be needed to
fully grasp the concept.

Next steps:
- Continuing to create interactive plots for data sets where applicable. The more data, and different plots, the better.
